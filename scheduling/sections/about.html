      <p>The above images are directed acyclic graphs of the pre-requisites for the majority of courses in the CSE department and requirements for graduation.  This does not contain all of the CSE department's course offerings, but seemed more comprehensive than any other available resources that I could find.</p>

      <p>This project began as a much smaller scale drawing in 2014 or 2015 that I had created to ensure that I could take all the course that I wanted to before graduation.  Since others also found the drawing helpful, it gradually increased in scale, became digital, and was eventually just put up on this website.</p>
